DETAILS & WORKFLOW
==================
Control is done almost exclusively via keyboard controls, so please do have a look at the shortcuts that are detailed on the first page!

Edits to script files are automatically saved to the local storage in your browser. These offline 'edits' are automatically removed when you sign out of the app. You can save these offline changes back up to your Google Apps Script. You can also view the difference or 'diff' between the local version, and the saved Google version.

Once you have saved your offline edits back, you can also commit them to a Github repository. To do this, you will first need to select a target repository. Once this is done, you can either commit a single file, or a collection of files. You can also use the 'diff' tool to check differences between you local code and the Github version.

There are simple file management tools (add a new file to a script, or remove one). If you are developing web applications using Google Apps Script, you can separate your files into HTML, JS & CSS files. Simply name your file file-name.js or file-name.css and they will be syntax highlighted appropriately (provided you use the <script></script> or <style></style> tag to top and tail each file).
