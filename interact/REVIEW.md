Review Commit
=============
COMMIT MESSAGE: {{MESSAGE}}

Below are a list of the files you wish to commit. If you would like to add a message/description, simply replace the default text above with your message (in a single paragraph without line breaks, retaining the text before, and including, the ':'). Try to keep the commit message quite short (<= 50 chars). Then press __[CTRL | ⌘] + ENTER__ to complete the commit. If you don't replace the text, it will be used as the commit message. If you wish to abandon the commit, press __[CTRL | ⌘] + X__.
