===================
A web-based tool for authoring Google Apps Scripts. Allows for easier editing, local storage, saving, diff'ing and committing to Github. Built atop of [Ace][1] for speed, familiarity and ease of use.

Most interaction is done via keyboard shortcuts for brevity and simplicity, and these are listed below. Small icons and colours are used to indicate current (‚ô•), changed (‚òÖ) and saved (‚úî) files.
